# Plugi - Beta
A massive, modifiable plugin for Minecraft servers.

## Welcome
Welcome to the beta branch of Plugi! These are the features that might get added to the next release of Plugi, but you can access them early here.

## Warnings
While being more stable than the experimental builds, the beta releases are still **EARLY ACCESS**. Please make a backup of your server before installing a beta build.

## Installation
To install a beta build of Plugi, go to the releases tab of this repository, download x.y-BETA-z (e.g 1.3-BETA-2) and replace the jar file with the currently installed version of Plugi. **NOTE** You do *not* need to have installed a stable release of Plugi before installing a beta.

## Before You Go
Have fun with the beta builds of Plugi! If you find any bugs, please open an issue and tag the issue with the release you are using (you can find this ingame by using the command /plugi version).
