# Plugi - Experimental
A massive, modifiable plugin for Minecraft servers.

## Welcome
Welcome to the experimental branch of Plugi! I'm happy that you've taken an interest in the most cutting-edge version of Plugi.

## Warnings
The experimental builds of Plugi are bound to be **HIGHLY UNSTABLE**. Make a backup of your server  **BEFORE** you install experimental builds of Plugi.

## Installation
Due to the fact that the Experimental builds can be unstable, you must compile the build yourself. If you have the JetBrains Toolbox Extension installed, you can click the IntelliJ icon beside "Clone or Download" to open this branch in IntelliJ. If you do not, but you use IntelliJ, you can download it on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-toolbox-extensi/offnedcbhjldheanlbojaefbfbllddna) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/jetbrains-toolbox/). Remove the current .jar file in your plugins folder and replace it with the built .jar file.

## Before You Go
Have fun with the experimental build of Plugi! If you find any bugs, please open an issue. If you ever want to switch back to stable releases or beta releases, simply replace the experimental build .jar with the stable or beta release .jar you want.
